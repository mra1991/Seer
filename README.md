 This Unity project is a first-person shooter with a magic twist. 
 You play as a wizard armed with a magic staff, shooting beams to capture ghosts and collect them. 
 The game boasts a variety of features to enhance gameplay, including physics, a custom environment, prefabs, 
 integrated animations, menus, loading screen, raycasting and overlap, particle systems, audio and AudioMixer.
In addition to these core features, there are several extra features that take the game to the next level. 
Post-processing effects bring a cinematic feel to the experience, with Motion Blur On/Off and Vignette effects 
used to simulate bleeding when taking damage. Trail and line renderers create stunning visual effects for 
the magic beams and projectiles, while the Input System ensures smooth control and immersive gameplay.
